        <h3>Do's and Don'ts in Pregnancy</h3>
        <h2>1. Do take a multivitamin</h2>
        <p>
          Eating a balanced diet that’s rich in vitamins and minerals is the
          best way to provide your body with all of the healthy nutrients it
          needs to support a growing baby. <br />A healthy diet alone, however,
          may not be enough for pregnancy.
          <br />
          Prenatal vitamins contain higher levels of certain nutrients that
          expectant mothers require at higher doses, such as:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>&#x2022; Folic acid</li>
          <li>&#x2022; Calcium</li>
          <li>&#x2022; Iron</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These vitamins assist with proper development of the fetus and help
          prevent birth defects. Your doctor can help you find a multivitamin or
          a series of vitamins that are best for you.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Do get lots of sleep</h2>
        <p>
          Changing hormone levels, anticipation, and anxiety can make sleep
          elusive during your 9 months of pregnancy. Pregnancy is demanding,
          especially in the final trimester, and you’ll need your sleep.
          <br />
          <br />
          Take a quick snooze if you feel tired and schedule naps whenever you
          can. Set bedtimes and stick to them.
          <br />
          Aim for 7-9 hours of shut-eye each night. Fatigue is a sign that your
          body needs more rest, so give yourself all the sleep you can.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Do work out</h2>
        <p>
          Gone are the days of pregnant women avoiding lifting a finger during
          their pregnancies: We now know that exercise is good for mama and
          baby. <br /><br />
          In fact, regular exercise may help you combat many of the issues that
          arise during pregnancy, including:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>&#x2022; Insomnia</li>
          <li>&#x2022; Muscle pain</li>
          <li>&#x2022; Excessive weight gain</li>
          <li>&#x2022; Mood problems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you regularly exercised before you became pregnant, keep it up.
          Talk with your doctor about any adjustments you should make to your
          routine, especially as you move into your second and third trimesters.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Do eat seafood</h2>
        <p>
          Seafood is loaded with vitamins and minerals, such as heart-healthy
          omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, and iron. These are all important for both
          mom and baby. But undercooked or raw seafood can cause some problems.
          <br /><br />Seafood may carry harmful bacteria and viruses, which are
          eliminated when thoroughly cooked. Also, pregnant women should avoid
          raw fish and fish that may contain high levels of mercury.
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          Examples of fish containing high levels of mercury include:
        </ul>
        <br />
        <li>&#x2022; Shark</li>
        <li>&#x2022; Swordfish</li>
        <li>&#x2022; Tilefish</li>
        <li>&#x2022; King mackerel</li>

        <h2>5. Do practice yoga</h2>
        <p>
          You should avoid Bikram or hot yoga, but other yoga modalities are
          fine when you’re expecting. Seek out prenatal or gentle yoga classes
          that are designed for mothers-to-be. Instructors in these classes will
          know which poses are best and which you should avoid.<br />
          <br />
          If you weren’t doing yoga before you became pregnant, talk with your
          doctor before signing up for a class. While it’s possible you can
          start, it’s best to go over the risks and concerns with your doctor.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Do get a flu shot</h2>
        <p>
          Pregnant women can and shouldTrusted Source get a flu vaccine as long
          as you don’t have a contraindication as noted by the manufacturer.
          <br /><br />
          The injection isn’t a live virus. You cannot get the flu from the flu
          vaccine. If you were to contract influenza during your pregnancy, the
          risk of severe side effects is greater than in women of the same age
          who aren’t pregnant.
          <br /><br />
          The vaccine will protect you as well as your developing fetus.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Do gain weight smartly</h2>
        <p>
          The “eat for two” advice to expecting mothers isn’t a license to eat
          whatever you’d like. Instead, women need to be strategic about what
          they eat and how much. <br /><br />
          Gaining a lot of weight during pregnancy may do more harm to your baby
          than good. During your first trimester, you only need about 100 extra
          calories a day to support your growing fetus.
          <br /><br />
          By your third trimester, that additional calorie number is closer to
          300 to 500 per day.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Don’t smoke</h2>
        <p>
          Babies born to women who smoke during pregnancy are more likelyTrusted
          Source to have a lower birth weight and are at a greater risk for
          learning disabilities than children born to nonsmoking mothers.
          <br /><br />
          Additionally, children born to women who smoke are more likely to try
          smoking at a younger age and become regular smokers earlier, due to
          physiologic nicotine addiction.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Don’t drink alcohol</h2>
        <p>
          Alcohol may greatly impact your baby’s development. People who drink
          alcohol while pregnant couldTrusted Source deliver a baby with fetal
          alcohol syndrome (FAS). <br /><br />
          Symptoms of FAS include:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>&#x2022; Low birth weight</li>
          <li>&#x2022; Learning disabilities</li>
          <li>&#x2022; Behavior problems</li>
          <li>
            &#x2022; lagging patterns in terms of growth and development
            milestones
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Even small amounts of alcohol can be a problem. There appears to be no
          safe level of alcohol intake in pregnancy.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Don’t eat raw meat</h2>
        <p>
          Raw and undercooked meat and eggs carry the risk of foodborne illness,
          such as listeriosis and toxoplasmosis. Food poisoning is also a
          possibility.
          <br /><br />
          These conditions can cause serious, life-threatening illnesses that
          could lead to severe birth defects and even miscarriage. Make sure all
          eggs and meat that you eat while pregnant are well-cooked.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Don’t eat unpasteurized milk products</h2>
        <p>
          Calcium is very important for growing babies, but moms have to be
          careful how they get their calcium from dairy. <br /><br />
          Raw milk isn’t recommendedTrusted Source for expecting mothers since
          it’s unpasteurized. This means it hasn’t been heated to kill bacteria
          that could make you ill.
          <br /><br />
          Specifically, raw milk may contain the bacteria Listeria. It can lead
          to illness, miscarriage, or even life-threatening consequences.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Don’t sit in a hot tub or sauna</h2>
        <p>
          Though relaxing, the high-heat environment of hot tubs, Jacuzzis, and
          saunas may be too dangerous for expecting mothers. <br /><br />
          In fact, research suggests that using one of these during your first
          trimester may double your risk of miscarriage. Soaking in hot water
          can raise body temperature and this causes problems with the baby
          including increasing the risk of birth defects.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Don’t drink a lot of caffeine</h2>
        <p>
          Caffeine can travel through the placenta and increase your baby’s
          heart rate. <br /><br />
          Current research suggests that women can safely consume a cup or two
          of coffee each day, but forego downing a triple-shot latte while
          you’re carrying.
