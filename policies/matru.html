    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) is a Centrally Sponsored flagship scheme by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India, designed to support pregnant women and lactating mothers. The scheme is to provide maternity benefits to women belonging to socially and economically disadvantaged sections of society. <br/><br/> The maternity benefit is to be provided to a woman for the first two living children provided the second child is a girl.<br/><br/> For the first child the maternity benefit of ₹5,000/- is provided in two instalments under PMMVY and the beneficiary is also entitled to receive the cash incentive as per approved norms towards Maternity Benefit under Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) after institutional delivery so that on an average, a women gets ₹6,000/-.<br/> <br/> For the second child, the benefit of ₹6,000/- is to be provided subject to second child is a girl child, in one installment after the birth. Cases of miscarriage/still births are to be treated as fresh cases for providing maternity benefit under the scheme. Further, as per the new guidelines for 'Mission Shakti’, applicable with effect from 01.04.2022, the scheme (PMMVY 2.0) seeks to promote positive behavioral change towards girl child by providing additional cash incentive for the second child, if that is a girl child. <br/><br/>Thus, for the second child, the benefit of ₹6,000/- is to be provided in one instalment post birth. This would contribute towards improving Sex Ratio at Birth by discouraging female feticide.
